# JWT-Generator-CLI -GoLang

A command-line tool that generates secure **JWT tokens** (JSON Web Tokens) based on user input.  
This tool simulates **how login systems** issue tokens in real-world cloud platforms.

---

## 📌 Why I Built This

In cloud-native applications, we need to authenticate users **without storing sessions on the server** (i.e., *stateless authentication*). JWTs allow us to:
- ✅ Authenticate users securely
- ✅ Carry user roles (admin, user) in the token
- ✅ Set an expiration to limit token validity
- ✅ Avoid server-side session storage

This CLI tool helps simulate the **JWT issuance** process during login.

----

## 🛠 Features

- Take username & role as input via CLI
- Create JWT with `username`, `role`, and `expiry`
- Sign token using HMAC-SHA256
- Print full JWT token to use in Authorization header

##  Example:
Enter username: komal
Enter role (admin/user): admin

Generated JWT token:
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...

Project: JWT Generator CLI in Go

🎯 1. Why Are You Building This Project?
Real-world use case: In cloud platforms (like Cisco Secure Access), when a user logs in, we don’t want to keep them logged in using a session stored on the server.

🔐 Solution? Generate a JWT (JSON Web Token) that carries the user’s data + role + expiry, and is signed using a secret so it can't be tampered with.

💡 This is exactly how secure APIs, cloud dashboards, microservices, and API gateways handle stateless authentication today.

🔧 2. What Problem Does This Project Solve?

Problem	Solution:
You want a user to log in and receive a token securely ->	Generate JWT containing user details
You want role-based access control -> 	Embed role (admin/user) in JWT
You want the token to expire ->	Add expiry using exp claim
You want to simulate login in a CLI or automation tool ->	Accept input in CLI and output a token

🧠 3. What Are You Implementing Technically?
Feature	Implementation:
CLI input	-> fmt.Scanln() for username and role
JWT generation	-> Using github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5
Expiry ->	time.Now().Add(24 * time.Hour).Unix()
Claims -> (data)	jwt.MapClaims{ "username": ..., "role": ..., "exp": ... }
Signing token	-> SignedString(jwtKey) using HS256

HS256

🧠 4. Logic Behind the Project

🔄 Step-by-Step Thinking:
Step	Thought Process
1. Take input from user ->	Ask for username and role
2. Use this input to create a secure token	-> Use JWT claims to hold the data
3. Add an expiry to the token	-> Prevent misuse or forever-valid tokens
4. Sign the token with a secret	-> So it can be verified but not faked
5. Print the token	-> So client can use it in future requests (e.g., API header)

✅ This mimics exactly how login APIs work in the backend.

🧑‍💻 5. How To Build This Project (Step by Step)
mkdir jwt token
cd jwt token
 Terminal : 
 go mod init jwt token
 go get github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5

-> Write a code in main.go
Run the file : go run main.go

| What is JWT?                                                  | A stateless token that holds JSON data (claims) securely and is signed. Used for auth.   |
| Why use JWT instead of sessions?                              | Sessions need server storage; JWTs are stored on the client and verified via signature.  |
| What does `exp` mean in a JWT?                                | It's the token expiration time. The token is invalid after this UNIX timestamp.          |
| What are the parts of a JWT?                                  | Header, Payload (claims), Signature. Each part is base64 encoded and separated by dots.  |
| How did you generate JWT in Go?                               | Used the `golang-jwt` package, created claims, signed with `SignedString()`.             |
| What is the difference between a signed and an encrypted JWT? | Signed = can't be tampered, readable. Encrypted = fully hidden, for high-security needs. |
| How is role-based access controlled in JWT?                   | Embed a `role` field in claims; backend checks it before allowing access.                |


### What Is Stateless Authentication?
Imagine logging into a system like Gmail or Cisco Secure Access. Normally:

🔴 In Traditional (Stateful) Authentication:
You log in → Server creates a session and stores it in memory

Each time you make a request → Server looks up your session

If server crashes or restarts → sessions may be lost

This means:

Server must remember you

Server needs to store session data (RAM/Database)

Not scalable in microservices or cloud

✅ In Stateless Authentication (using JWT):
You log in → Server gives you a JWT token (with your info inside)

You store it on your browser or mobile app

Every request you make → You send the token → Server verifies it, doesn’t store anything

If token is valid, you’re allowed access. No server memory needed.

Stateless = Server doesn’t store who is logged in — it just verifies the token.

--> Where Is Stateless Authentication Used Today?
Industry	Example
🌐 Web Applications	Google, Facebook, Netflix use JWT tokens
☁️ Cloud Security	Cisco Secure Access, AWS IAM uses stateless tokens
📱 Mobile Apps	Android/iOS apps store JWT to access APIs
🔐 API Gateways	Authenticated access to microservices
🚀 DevOps Tools	Kubernetes Dashboard, Jenkins login tokens
🧠 Zero Trust Networks	Where every request must be verified using a token

🧠 Why Do Engineers Prefer Stateless?
Reason	Why it Matters
✅ Scalable	No sessions to store per user
✅ Faster	Verifies token, doesn’t need DB check
✅ Secure	Tokens have expiry & are signed
✅ Portable	Token can be used across services or APIs
✅ Works well in Microservices	Each service can validate token independently

Note: Stateless authentication means the server doesn't store any user session. Instead, it issues a signed JWT token to the user, which includes user details, roles, and expiry. Each request carries the token, and the server just verifies it using a secret. This is scalable, secure, and used in all modern cloud platforms, including Cisco Secure Access.


Concept	Explanation: 

fmt.Scanln()	Reads user input from terminal (Go CLI)
time.Now().Add(24 * time.Hour)	Adds 1 day to current time for token expiry
MapClaims	Map-like structure where we add data into token
SignedString(jwtKey)	Creates a secure JWT by signing it with secret key
Unix()	Converts time to UNIX timestamp (used in JWT exp)
